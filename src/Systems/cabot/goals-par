# The goals-par file lists the goal hierarchy in terms of which goals can be top-level goals by themselves (those with no parent) and which are only subgoals of the listed parent goals. 
# The instance after the arrow is the comma-separated list of parent goals, if any 
# If a speech act is listed as a parent, preceded by an @ symbol, then this goal will be a possible suggestion for the speech act if there is no active goal.
# If a speech is listed as a parent, preceded by a ^ symbol, then the parent goal will be accepted implicitly when receiving that speech act
